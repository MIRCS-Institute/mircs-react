                        Oral history has it that, as the city became better established, Irish Catholics
                        migrated out of the early central waterfront district. This story claims that the area directly north of the Citadel became
                        the home of many Irish Catholics during the second half of the nineteenth
                        century. It is the neighbourhood which gave birth to Saint Patrick's Catholic
                        Church, and in the 1950s, congregations there hit 5500 people per Sunday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the late nineteenth century, however, this neighbourhood housed quite a few
                        other churches: St. John's Presbyterian, St. George's Anglican, North Baptist,
                        Cornwallis Baptist, Hurd's Lane Baptist, Brunswick Methodist, Windsor Methodist,
                        and the Church of the Redeemer Universalist. This profusion of churches raises a question about the ethno-religious character
                        of the neighbourhood.
                        <br></br><br></br>Was it really as Irish Catholic as our oral history suggests?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are building a prototype for the Old North End community for our large
                        geo-genealogy project, and expect this prototype, among other things, will be
                        able to tell us just what the ethnic, religious, and socio-economic character of
                        the neighbourhood actually was in the late nineteenth century.<br></br><br></br>
                        The year 1881 has been selected for this initial project.
                        <br></br><br></br>There is a McAlpine's City Directory available close to that date, and
                        that year the 1881 national census was conducted, which details demographic,
                        social and economic information. But the choice of year was also motivated by its symbolic significance.
                        1883 was the year in which the cornerstone was laid for Saint Patrick's Church,
                        and the results we get should say something in terms of demographics about why
                        the church was built. That is if the oral history is actually correct.

                        The boundaries we are using are mapped by North Street, Windsor Street,
                        Cogswell, and the harbour. Within that neighbourhood, we have taken a random sample of five hundred
                        households.During the winter and spring (2015), we built profiles of most of these
                        households, identifying the composition and links between spouses, children,
                        domestics, and lodgers, and developing information on occupations, ethnicity,
                        and religion.

                    <h2>Durham & the West River of Pictou?</h2>
                </div>

                <div style={styles.paragraph}>

                    <p>
                        The 'West River of Pictou' is an area defined by the watershed of the West River
                        in Pictou County. With limited infrastructure, stores, or churches in the late
                        eighteenth century, though, the community itself in this area was referred to as
                        'West River'. It was not until the 1830s that the market centre, Durham,
                        developed its own name, and not until mid-century that other villages and small
                        communities started to form themselves with identities separate from the larger
                        West River area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Durham community, a small rural village on the West River some 10 km
                        upstream from Pictou Town, was once one of the intellectual cross-roads of Nova
                        Scotia, and the primary market centre within the West River region. The
                        community only obtained the name "Durham" sometime after 1838. The Rev. John
                        Peter MacPhie indicates that "Durham did not receive its present name until the
                        time of the late Lord Durham in Canada. The name was the suggestion of the late
                        William Graham, merchant, and was confirmed at a public meeting held for the
                        purpose. The late Miss Margaret Cameron of Durham distinctly remembered the
                        meeting, and that it was on Mr. Graham's motion that the name Durham was chosen"
                        (1914: 21).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Settled by emigrants from the Dumfries and Galloway region of Scotland in the
                        late 1700s (MacPhie, 1914: 16), many of them were Dissenting Presbyterians,
                        evangelicals dissenting from the established Church of Scotland (Kirk). "To
                        Durham was early moved the first Presbyterian Church, located originally at Loch
                        Broom" (MacPhie, 1914: 21-22). By the end of the nineteenth century, Durham was
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is only when we pull on the thread which MacKenzie has given us about the
                        Seminary and Theological Hall that we can understand Durham's historical place.
                        It is a thread that leads to the establishment of Dalhousie University in
                        Halifax, and a central role for the Scottish Presbyterians in the intellectual
                        life of the province.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the early leaders in the community was James Drummond MacGregor, the
                        first minister of Durham Presbyterian Church during the period 1786 to 1801
                        (Buggey, 2015). MacGregor was naturally influenced by his Scottish education,
                        and Alan Wilson has recently argued that MacGregor was the "Father of the
                        Scottish Enlightenment in Nova Scotia", a poet and preacher who "established the
                        Pictou Academy, campaigned against slavery [see, particularly, Letter to a
                        Clergyman], promoted scientific education, industry, agriculture, the Gaelic
                        language, and Scottish culture" (Wilson, 2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Rev. George Patterson has noted that a second minister, the Rev. Duncan
                        Ross, joined James MacGregor in 1795, and the two ministered to the whole of
                        Pictou county for the next six years. At that time,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patterson didn't record the death of the Rev. Duncan Ross, nor did he write
                        about Duncan's son, the Rev. James Ross (1811-1886), but Patterson's own son,
                        Judge George Patterson, filled this gap by writing an article, "The Second
                        Principal of Dalhousie College", published in his Studies in Nova Scotia
                        History. James studied at the Pictou Academy under Dr. Thomas MacCulloch (famous
                        for his anti-papist tracts by then) and received his teaching licence.
                        <br></br>James went on to teach school at the Grammar School in Sackville, N.B.,
                        and it was from there that he responded to a call from Durham Presbyterian
                        Church following the death of his father, and became ordained in 1835. At that
                        time, the congregation numbered about 175 families, and Allan Dunlop (1982)
                        notes that James was "paid £150 a year in cash and produce" and operated, in
                        addition, a large farm of his own.
                        <br></br>From this modest beginning, Ross initiated a move which established a
                        seminary and Theological Hall in Durham.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From these beginnings, there flows a development trajectory of some consequence
                        to the province. With the founding of the Seminary and Theological Hall in
                        Durham, the Rev. James Ross was able to establish Durham as the intellectual
                        centre of Presbyterianism in Pictou county ("the ecclesiastical and educational
                        centre" MacPhie, 1914: 20).
                        <br></br>In order to see how this became significant for Dalhousie University
                        and Scottish Enlightenment culture in Nova Scotia, it is necessary to understand
                        Dalhousie's position (for a discussion of the first founding of Dalhousie and
                        the role of Thomas MacCulloch, see Buggey and Davies, 2015; and McCulloch,
                        1920). Dalhousie had initially been founded in 1838 and was able to continue
                        until 1845, but was then dormant for almost twenty years.<br></br>
                        It was dormant for a reason: the Roman Catholics had St. Francis Xavier College
                        in Antigonish and Saint Mary's College in Halifax, the Anglicans had King's
                        College in Windsor, the Methodists had Mount Allison College in Sackville
                        (N.B.), and the Baptists had Acadia College in Wolfville.
                        <br></br>The only market possible for Dalhousie was the Presbyterians, and the
                        Presbyterian stronghold was Pictou county.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the union of the Dissenting Presbyterians in Nova Scotia in 1860, the stage
                        was set for greater institutionalization. The newly formed Presbyterian Church
                        of the Lower Provinces amalgamated their Seminaries in Halifax, and in concert
                        with the Church of Scotland in Nova Scotia (the Kirk), "a resolution was come to
                        by the Union Colleges to attempt its [Dalhousie's] rehabilitation" (Rattray,
                        1880: 838).
                        <br></br>The Rev. George Munro Grant - a graduate of the West River Seminary
                        under Ross - played a key role: "Grant whose congregation included William
                        Young, the chairman of the board of governors of Dalhousie since 1848, made good
                        use of his old connections at the West River seminary in helping along the
                        negotiations which resulted in a new university act in 1863.
                        <br></br>The two churches endowed chairs and the Rev.
                        <br></br>James Ross transferred his classes from his seminary, now based at
                        Truro, to Dalhousie and became its president" (Mack, 2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Durham, in short, was the intellectual base from which James Ross and the
                        Presbyterians established Dalhousie University as the centre for Scottish
                        Enlightenment culture during the rest of the nineteenth century.<br></br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so it goes. We are extending this history with a geo-genealogy of the
                        residents of the village, beginning with the 1881 census. This work is being led
                        by the Durham Heritage Society.
