 <p>
 Since the fall of 2014, we have been building initial components for a geo-genealogy prototype for the province. Working partnerships have been formed with the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia, the Genealogical Association of Nova Scotia, and the Durham Heritage Society. Several faculty at Dalhousie University - within the Business School, the GISciences Centre, sand Faculty of Computer Science - have helped facilitate initial work.

 Historical maps are colourful and compelling for many people. The geography of those maps, though, is one way of introducing more context into our understanding of social patterns. The search for general social laws is long past dead, and much intellectual effort now is aimed at figuring out how to better incorporate temporal and spatial contexts into our knowledge of social phenomena. However, if social action is a result of the various purposes and beliefs which individuals hold, then our social understanding must become very local indeed. We accept the geographer's argument that geography, by locating action in space, contextualizes it in another equally fundamental way to history which contextualizes time. We think, therefore, that historical gis which contextualizes both time and space is a tool which can greatly advance this kind of improved understanding of context
