## create-react-app

The basic structure of this project was created with the create-react-app script provided by Facebook - https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app. It installs a fairly opinionated environment based on Facebook's experience with their own React framework and represents the efforts of many smart people. I am grateful to their efforts and appreciate our ability to leverage it. To that end, I do not want us to "eject" and modify the environment. We can do things the "React way" and wrap to extend.

For more information on React see Facebook's developer pages - https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html
