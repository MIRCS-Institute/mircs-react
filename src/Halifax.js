 <div> Oral history has it that, as the city became better established, Irish Catholics migrated out of the early central waterfront district. This story claims that the area directly north of the Citadel became the home of many Irish Catholics during the second half of the nineteenth century. It is the neighbourhood which gave birth to Saint Patrick's Catholic Church, and in the 1950s, congregations there hit 5500 people per Sunday.

In the late nineteenth century, however, this neighbourhood housed quite a few other churches: St. John's Presbyterian, St. George's Anglican, North Baptist, Cornwallis Baptist, Hurd's Lane Baptist, Brunswick Methodist, Windsor Methodist, and the Church of the Redeemer Universalist. This profusion of churches raises a question about the ethno-religious character of the neighbourhood. Was it really as Irish Catholic as our oral history suggests?

We are building a prototype for the Old North End community for our large geo-genealogy project, and expect this prototype, among other things, will be able to tell us just what the ethnic, religious, and socio-economic character of the neighbourhood actually was in the late nineteenth century. The year 1881 has been selected for this initial project. There is a McAlpine's City Directory available close to that date, and that year the 1881 national census was conducted, which details demographic, social and economic information. But the choice of year was also motivated by its symbolic significance. 1883 was the year in which the cornerstone was laid for Saint Patrick's Church, and the results we get should say something in terms of demographics about why the church was built. That is if the oral history is actually correct.

The boundaries we are using are mapped by North Street, Windsor Street, Cogswell, and the harbour. Within that neighbourhood, we have taken a random sample of five hundred households. During the winter and spring (2015), we built profiles of most of these households, identifying the composition and links between spouses, children, domestics, and lodgers, and developing information on occupations, ethnicity, and religion.

We have set up a development site (see below) to display and map this information, and are working on refinements and improvements to the model. Once it is stabilized, we will then be able to proceed with an analysis of the data, and expect that this will allow us to answer the question we have asked about the historical composition of the neighbourhood. </div>
